Rust is a systems-programming language created by Mozilla in 2010.

Having low-level capabilites, it is an alternative to languages like C and C++.

*But why should you care about Rust?*

## Quick introduction to Rust

What makes Rust great?

<!-- What makes Rust so attractive? -->

---

#### Goals

- Speed.
- Safety.
- Concurrency.
- Practicality.

![bg right 70%](https://free4kwallpapers.com/uploads/originals/2020/04/27/fast-car-wallpaper.jpg)

<!--
    - Compiled language.
    - No garbage collection.

-->

<!--
     - No `null`s.
     - No dangling pointers.
     - No *unsafe*.
-->

<!--
    - No race conditions.
    - No deadlocks.
    - *Fearless concurrency*.
-->

---

### Meet the *borrow-checker*

- Each variable has an *owner*.
- You can reference another variable's value via a *reference*.
- You may either have any number of *immutable* references, or only one
  *mutable* reference at the same time.

---

### Memory safety 

Say *Goodbye!* to memory issues and other common runtime exceptions. Never more:

- Segfaults.
- `cannot access member 'x' of undefined`.
- Invalid pointers.
- Uncaught exceptions.

---

### Fearless concurrency

The borrow-checker rules make common concurrency issues *impossible*.

**Concurrency has never been easier!**

---

### Idiomatic syntax

Familiar, easy-to-understand syntax.

*Low-level power with high-level syntax.*

---

### Modern language features

- Pattern matching.
- Enum variants.
- Closures.
- Async/await.
- Macros!

---

### Rich type system

- Type aliases.
- Type inference.
- Structs (with methods).
- Enum variants.
- Traits (similar to Haskell *typeclasses* and OOP interfaces).
- Generics (types, traits, lifetimes).
- Helpful error messages and tips.

---

### Modern tooling

#### Cargo ![height:1em](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41265192/44623012-be9fcc00-a8c4-11e8-9943-646e3c682292.png)

- Build tool
- Package manager.
- Test runner.
- Docs generator.

- Extensible with *plugins*.

---

#### Crates.io ![height:1em](https://crates.io/assets/Cargo-Logo-Small.png)

Rust's crate registry.

#### Rustfmt

Awesome formatting.

#### Rust Analyzer ![height:1em](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1217461647377420289/HXHa6hZU_400x400.jpg)

Great IDE and editor support.

#### Rustup

Get all your toolchain from a single place!

---

### Great learning material and community

- Official book: *The Rust Programming Language*
- Generated crate docs.
- Growing community of *Rusteaceans*.

# Hands on!

Let's build our first application with Rust.

---

## What we're building

A terminal hangman game.

![width:400px](https://media.istockphoto.com/illustrations/simple-illustration-of-hangman-game-illustration-id1196954772?k=20&m=1196954772&s=612x612&w=0&h=nzsr9bCwxp9xW3dp-nBJeXE7TVGqnWtdJpbaXvEyl3E=)

---

## What we'll learn

- Setting up a project.
- Rust's basic syntax.
- Basic error handling.
- Enums, pattern matching, traits, closures...
- Using external *crates*.
- Rust's module system.
- Basic unit testing.

---

# Our project is finished!

Now what?

---

# Some great material

- *The Rust Programming Language* book.
- [*Let's Get Rusty*](https://www.youtube.com/c/LetsGetRusty) Youtube channel.

# Challenges!

Some projects you can make:

- Snake game using *Piston*.
- Build a REST API using *Rocket* (web framework) and *Diesel* (ORM).
- Create a WASM web app with *Yew* (*React developers might be interested*)
- Make a cool CLI app with *tui-rs*.

The possibilites are endless!
