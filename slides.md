## Quick introduction to Rust

<!-- What makes Rust so attractive? -->

---

#### Goals

- Speed.
    - Compiled language.
    - No garbage collection.
- Safety.
     - No `null`s.
     - No dangling pointers.
     - No *unsafe*.
- Concurrency.
    - No race conditions.
    - No deadlocks.
    - *Fearless concurrency*.

---

### Meet the *borrow-checker*

- Each variable has an *owner*.
- You can reference another variable's value via a *reference*.
- You may either have any number of *immutable* references, or only one
  *mutable* reference at the same time.

---

[Example here]

---

### Memory safety 

Say *Goodbye!* to memory issues. Never more:

- Segfaults.
- `cannot access member 'x' of undefined`.
- Invalid pointers.

---

### Fearless concurrency

The borrow-checker rules make common concurrency issues *impossible*.

**Concurrency has never been easier!**

---

### Idiomatic syntax

Familiar, easy-to-understand syntax.

---

### Modern language features

- Pattern matching.
- Enum variants.
- Closures (anonymous functions).
- Async/await (even before than JS!).

---

### Rich type system

- Type aliases.
- Type inference.
- Structs (with methods).
- Traits (similar to Haskell *typeclasses*).
- Generics.

- Helpful error messages and tips.

---

### Modern tooling

#### Cargo

- Build tool
- Package manager.
- Test runner.

- Extensible with *plugins*.

---

#### Rustfmt

Awesome formatting.

#### Rust Analyzer

Great IDE and editor support.

---

#### Rustup

Get all your toolchain from a single place!

---

- Doc generator.
- The Book.
